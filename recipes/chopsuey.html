        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Fill a bowl halfway with ice and enough water to cover ice. Add 1/2 teaspoon salt for each quart of water. Set aside.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, bring 3 cups of salted water to a boil. Add carrots and cook for about 1 minute or until half done. With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and plunge into bowl of ice bath. </li>
            <li>Add broccoli and cauliflower to the boiling water and cook for about 2 to 3 minutes or until half-done. With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and plunge into the ice bath.</li>
            <li>Add cabbage to the boiling water and cook for about 30 seconds or until half-done. With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and plunge into the ice bath.</li>
            <li>Add peppers to the boiling water and cook for about 30 seconds or until half-done. With a slotted spoon, remove from pan and plunge into the ice bath.</li>
            <li>Reserve 2 cups of the poaching liquid (the one used to blanch vegetables).</li>
            <li>Drain vegetables from the ice bath when they are cold.</li>
            <li>In a wok or wide skillet over medium heat, heat about 2 tablespoons of the oil.</li>
            <li>Add chicken liver in a single layer and fry until lightly browned on all sides but not fully cooked. Remove from pan and keep warm.</li>
            <li>Discard excess oil and wipe down the pan. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon of oil and heat.</li>
            <li>Add onions and garlic and cook until softened.</li>
            <li>Add chicken and cook, stirring regularly, until color changes.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the reserved poaching liquid and oyster sauce. Add to the pan and bring to a boil. Continue to cook, skimming scum that may float on top, for about 4 to 5 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. </li>
            <li>Add the liver and cook for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add parboiled vegetables, baby corn, and quail eggs, stirring gently to combine, and cook for about 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine 1/4 cup of cold water and corn starch and stir until corn starch is dissolved. Add mixture to the pan, stirring gently. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes or until sauce is thickened.</li>
